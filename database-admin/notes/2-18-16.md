# SQL

**Declarative**, not **procedural** (no loops, detc.)  You just specify what you want.
query optimizer and query planner decies what the fastest way to retrieve the information asked for by the SQL statement.

Three types of sql statements:
Data manipulation language (DML): SELECT INSERT UPDATE DELETE TRUNCATE
data definition (DDL): CREATE ALTER DROP
data control language (DCL): GRANT REVOKE
Transaction Control Language (TCL): COMMIT ROLLBACK and SAVEPOINT

Output of a sql statement is a table.

SELECT (columns) FROM (table) WHERE (condition);

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies;
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE imdb_rank = 1;
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE imdb_rank in (12, 123, 1234);
SELECT DISTINCT film_year FROM movies;
SELECT * FROM movies as "movie" WHERE imdb_rank = 1;
SELECT * FROM movies as "movie" WHERE film_title LIKE "%Godfather%";
SELECT film_title AS "title" FROM movies WHERE imdb_rank = 1;
SELECT * FROM movies as "movie" WHERE imdb_rank IS NOT NULL AND ...;
SELECT * FROM movies as "movie" WHERE film_year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2012;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies WHERE imdb_rank = 1;
```

SQL has 3 logical booleans: TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN

Comparing a NULL to a NULL evaluates to UNKOWN

COALESCE(column, value)  like python {}.get(column, value)

<> == !=

With LIKE "%" matches any number of character and "_" matchets one character.
Like also requires single quotes for some reason.

ORDER BY column ASC | DESC


## Multirelation queries


```sql
select 
  m1.film_title,
  m2.file_title
from 
  movies m1,
  movies m2,
where
  m1.director_id = m2.director_id and
  m1.film_title < m2.film_title
```
When doing a join on the same table to itself you need to make sure not to show the duplicate.

Doing a subquery

```sql
SELECT 
  imdb_rank,
  film_title
FROM
  movies
WHERE
  runtime > (SELECT AVG(runtime) from movies)
ORDER BY
  imdb_rank ASC;
```

With AVG null is ignored.

ALL()  and ANY() subquery

```sql
SELECT
  film_title,
  budget
FROM
  movies
WHERE
  budget >= ALL(
    SELECT budget
    FROM movies
    WHERE budget IS NOT NULL);
```


A biag is a generalization of a set in which memebers may appear multiple times.  SQL treats relations as bags. Sets contain all unique tuples

DISTINCT gets rid of distint values.

UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, 

DISTINCT is very costly operation, speed it up by sorting first.

UNION ALL, INTERSECT ALL, EXCEPT ALL preserves the bads and doesn't remove the duplicates.


```sql
SELECT film_title
FROM likes, movies
WHERE
  likes.film_id = movies.film_id and
  fan_id = 22)
INTERSECT
(SELECT film_title
FROM showtimes, movies
WHERE
  showtimes.film_id = movies.film_id
```

`SELECT * from movies cross join tag_lines`: creates a Cartesian Product.

NAUTRAL JOIN joins nautrally shared keys, usually want to avoid it and use INNER JOIN (table) on (table.column) = (table.column) 
INNER JOIN: Only matching values in each tables.


```sql
SELECT
 film_title, movies.film_id as movieid, taglines.film_id as taglineid
 FROM movies
 LEFT OUTER JOIN taglines on movies.film_id = taglines.film_id;
```

LEFT OUTER JOIN: I am taking all rows from the left regardless if there is a match


GROUP BY - One or more attributes.
HAVING - each grouping meets the speicifed conditions.

if you clump with GROUP BY or HAVING you are going to have to aggregate with one of the following:

COUNT
SUM
AVG
MIN
MAX

```sql
SELECT
  genre,
  COUNT(*) as film_count
FROM
  movies INNER JOIN genres
    ON movies.film_id = genres.film_id
GROUP BY genre;
```

```sql
SELECT
  genre,
  MAX(film_year)
FROM
  movies INNER JOIN genres
    ON movies.film_id = genres.film_id
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY genre;
```

LOWER
UPPER
LTRIM
RTRIM

```sql
SELECT
  LOWER(LTRIM(RTRIM(genre))) as genre,
  MAX(film_year)
FROM
  movies INNER JOIN genres
    ON movies.film_id = genres.film_id
GROUP BY LOWER(LTRIM(RTRIM(genre)))
ORDER BY LOWER(LTRIM(RTRIM(genre)));
```

ROUND(column, -1)  integer is devimal places to the left.

```sql
SELECT
  genre,
  MAX(film_year)
FROM
  movies INNER JOIN genres
    ON movies.film_id = genres.film_id
GROUP BY genre
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN runtime < 120 THEN "SHORT"
    WHEN runtime > 140 THEN "LONG"
    ELSE 'Error'
  END AS runtime
...
```

`CREATE VIEW <virtual relation name> as SELECT ...`

Views are "new tables" that are stored in the database, and analysts can be given access to them.

Some databases support materialized views.  With normal view everytime the view is accessed the query
gets executed and loaded into the memory then the new query is run on that table.
Materialzed views get stored as an actual table, but now it must be maintained.


INSERT INTO table [(col1, col2)]
VALUES (val1, val2)

UPDATE table
SET column = "value"
WHERE condition

DELETE table
WHERE column = value

TRUNCATE table -> deletes everything


CREATE table
