if you want to test bias of a categorical variable you hold the other variables constant.


Model Building:
Theory: 1 model for each theory
Exploratory: 

"Build up": Start with a simple model, add terms (more likely to end up with a simpler model)
"Build down": Start with a complex model, remove terms (more likely to end up with a complex model)

Type 1 Error: Reject the null hypothesis when it is True (Adding unimportant terms to a model is a type 1 error)
Type 2 Error: Accepting the null hypothesis when it is False (Not having important terms in the model)

Build down.  When removing variables it has to make sense. Some ways of doing it:
- Remove all curvature.
- Use curvature in quantitative and interaction for qualitative.

Shift is a first order term.  Rate of curvature is the second order term.

External Model Validation:
- Assess validity of model when applied to "external" data
- Collect new data (y, x1, x2, x3, ...)
- Predict y using x s from new data and prediction equation from original analysis
- Computer psuedo R^2 and 2s -- evaluate

"Jackknife method" - leave out 1 observations from sample.
Fit model using (n-1) data points.
Predict y for omitted observations using associated x s and prediction equation form fitted model.
Repeat for all n observations.
Compute pseudo R^2 and 2s, compare to results for complete sample.
PRESS statistic in SAS.
