Any statistic you feel is a good measure of model accuracy


# Regression Pitfalls

Obervational data - difficult to establish "causality"
Extrapolation - predicting y for x-values outside range of sample data
Parameter estimates - can all betas be estimated: n > # betas && df(Error) > 0
Multicollinearity - x vals correlated


# Estimating Betas

Model with QN -x : # levels >= order + 1
MOdel with 1 QL-x: n >=2 at each level
Model with 1 QN & 1 QL: # level
grrr...
