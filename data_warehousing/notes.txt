Kimballs Bus architecture "Focused on small incremental advancements"

The primray objective of most DW/BI systems is to monitor the performance results
of these key processes.  Because of unique granularity, time interval, dimensionality
these processes typical sprawl over multiple fact tables.

The value chain is often expressed as a workflow or set of core business processes
Operational systems often produce transactions at each step.
These stepwise transactions are perfect for analytics that monitor core processes
Fact tables can be used for each process

With periodic snapshot fact tables where you cannot express the granularity
in terms of a transaction, so a list of dimensions is needed instead.


All measures that record a static level (inventory levels, financial account balances,
and measures of intensity such as room temperatures) are inherintly non-additive across the date-dimension
and possible others.

Periodic snapshots fact tables are likely to be dense not sparse like transaction fact tables.
you will see an invetory number for every product at every snapshot.

Dense fact tables can become quite large.
Ways of controlling storage growth include adjusting the snapshot period, retention policies
tiered levels of aggregation (combinations of daily, weekly, monthly, snapshots)

Inventory levels are not additive because they represent a certain level or balance at one point in time

Acumulating snapshot fact tables
are used for processes that have a definite beginning, end, and identifiable milestones in between
One row is placed in the fact table when a particular product is received in the warehouse
The disposition of this product is tracked until it leaves the warehouse.
Always have multiple date foreign keys
Row updated each time a milstone is reached.
