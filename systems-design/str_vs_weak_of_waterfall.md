STRENGTHS:

- Works with small teams, even one person.
- Not alot of overhead (no training etc).

WEAKNESSES:

- Not repeatable and thus not measurable.
- Easy to miss important details.
- No plan for refactoring and or improvment.
- Can potentially lose time, because there isnt a process (teams have to take time delegating).
