 Course Description: Software-intensive systems are the most interesting and challenging artifacts ever designed and developed by humans. Software has the capability to solve the most difficult problems accurately and efficiently. It is ubiquitous in all aspects of our lives.  Future complex software-intensive systems will be vastly different from the systems that run today’s world.  Revolutionary advances in hardware, networking, information, and human interface technologies will require entirely new ways of thinking about how software-intensive systems are conceptualized, designed, built, and evaluated. Research and development must provide the foundations for managing issues of complexity, quality, cost, and human intellectual control of software-intensive systems.   

 Course Objectives: The goal of this course is to instruct you in the technical and managerial foundations of software engineering and information systems development.  Based on a prerequisite understanding of basic systems concepts, you will learn to manage and perform activities throughout the software-intensive systems development life cycle, from the analysis of system requirements through system design to system implementation, testing, and maintenance. The roles of creativity and analytics are highlighted throughout the software development processes. Current best practices in systems development are presented and research challenges are discussed. 

 Learning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

Apply agile and disciplined methods in the design of a software development life cycle process
Determine functional and quality requirements of a system using rigorous requirements engineering techniques.
Understand the different specification approaches for software development (e.g. model-driven specification, software architectures, formal specification)
Design software systems using component-based development methods
Design software systems using web services and service-oriented architectures
Develop strategies for software testing using functional and structural testing methods
Design secure software systems with the latest cybersecurity methods
Understand and be able to apply the latest software engineering best practices in the areas of Cloud-based Computing, Systems Reengineering, Metrics, GreenIT Methods, and Human Computer Interactions
Demonstrate proficiency with a state-of-the-art software Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g. ArgoUML)
Understand the importance of creativity in the design and evaluation of software systems

 Hot Topic Assignment and In-Class Discussions: This assignment will give each student an opportunity to investigate in depth a current 'hot' topic in the field of software systems development.  You will select a topic that is of particular interest to you. It will be important to choose a topic at an appropriate level of detail in order to complete this report during the semester. Thus, Human-Computer Interactions is too broad a topic to cover in detail while Polymorphic Data Abstractions in Java is too narrow a topic (as well as too technical). Topics that are more aligned with courses in database systems or telecommunications will not be approved. Your topic should mesh both technical and managerial aspects of software development.

 For this assignment, you may assume that your manager (i.e. the instructor) wants a comprehensive report on the current status of research, development, and practice (RDP) in your chosen topic. An RDP survey should be concise, around 20 to 25 pages, but comprehensive. The survey should include respected references from recent R&D and trade journals. I would expect to see from 10 - 15 referen­ces in the final report. The survey should highlight the current state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice on the topic. Recommendations to your manager (e.g. This is how we should incorporate “this topic” in our software development organization.) will be provid­ed in the report’s conclusion. 

 On or before February 23, 2016, before the beginning of class 3, each student will upload in the Assignment Folder: Hot Topic Your write-up should a one-page proposal stating the hot topic, a discussion describing your interest in the topic, and a of list several initial references that you have found. I will provide feedback on your topic - too broad, too narrow, tenuous connection with software development - and recommend additional references on the topic. The sooner you receive my OK, the sooner you can begin this assignment. If you need help identifying a topic, see me.

 The Hot Topic Report is due on April 05, 2016 by 5.00pm.

 You will submit an electronic copy of the report into the Assignment area of Canvas. At the same time, you will post a brief summary of your hot topic on the Discussion Board in Canvas along with a copy of the Hot Topic Report. After reviewing the range of topics from other students in the class, you will select and read at least two reports from other students. Add comments to the Discussion Board based on your readings. You will have two weeks to review and read these reports.

 During the Hot Topic class on April 19, 2016, the instructor will lead a discussion of the hot topics. Students will be asked to briefly highlight the key lessons learned from their hot topic reports as well as discuss the reports they read from other students. 

 ICASE Assignment: The objective of this assignment is to provide students a hands-on experience with an industrial strength ICASE system. This is a take-home assignment. The assignment will be available on Canvas on March 22, 2016 (Class 7) and will be due on March 29 by 5.00 pm.

  Group Project: The objective of the Group Project assignment is to provide a real-world experience to the students about various aspects of software design and development.

A. Project Assignment

 Project teams will perform software development activi­ties on a selected information system. Project teams will consist of 3 ± 1 class members of your own formation. Teams should identify an existing business information system. The information system should be large and interesting enough to provide a challenging project. Team members must have access to the details of the system and to responsible individuals who manage and use the system. The scope of this project is to perform activities of investigation, requirements analysis, and evolutionary design on the selected information system.

B. System Requirements Analysis and Design

 During the investigation activities, the team will discover the natural description of how the information system works. Do this by interviewing knowledgeable individuals and by reviewing documentation on the system. You should formulate the system description in appropriate system structures using modeling graphics and languages.  Also, during inves­tigation, you should discover information on the objectives and requirements of the system.  Does the current informa­tion system meet these objectives and requirements?  A thorough analysis should include a short discussion on the current status and quality of the information system.

 Then, based on the information you discovered, produce an evolutionary (improved) design for the chosen information system to better meet its objectives and requirements. Develop a system design to include the major subsystems and a more detailed look at one of the subsystems. Clearly justify all design decisions made in this process. Place the final designs and design decisions in the final project report.

 C. Using a ICASE Tool

 Each team is expected to use an ICASE tool to produce requirements and design models for the project. For example, entity-relationship diagrams, data flow diagrams, and/or UML diagrams may be used. A good word processor or graphics tool (e.g. MS Visio) or an ICASE system such as ARGO/UML can be used for this assignment.  Each team is free to employ the analysis and design techniques they find most appropriate to complete this assignment.

 D. Project Milestones and Deliverables

 Your project team should select the information system to be studied based upon your interests and availability of resources.  On or before March 1, 2016 before the beginning of class, each team will  upload a one-page short proposal on their project on Canvas. The sooner you decide on a target system, the sooner you can begin the project. The proposal should include a description of the selected system and a sched­ule of activities to complete the project. I will review each propos­al and suggest improvements. I may request that a team recon­sider its proposal and submit a revision.

 The final reports are due by the end of the day via Canvas submission on May 1, 2016. The final report for the project should include an Executive Summary, a Management Overview of all activities in the project, the Requirements documents, all analyses performed, the Design documents, and a final section on Conclu­sions, Recommenda­tions, and Lessons Learned by the team. Abridged transcripts of interviews can be included in the Specification. Large documentation sources (e.g., program list­ings, user manuals, etc.) need not be included, only a concise sum­mary of their contents. The size of the report should range from 20 to 40 pages including any ICASE tool reports.

 April 26, 2016 (12th Class), each group will deliver a 12-minute presentation and discussion of the project in the class. Details and scheduling of this presentation will be provided toward the end of the semester. Each presentation will be followed by a brief Q&A. The dress code for the presentations is business casuals.

 Important dates related to Group Project: Proposal Due on – February 23, 2016;          Group Presentations – April 26, 2016; Final Report Due on – May 1, 2016

 E. Grading Standards for Group Project

 The group project will count for 25% of your course grade. For each person the project grade will determined as follows:
