SOA is a design pattern for IT architecture where business logic is operated into “Services” (usually applications) that exists separately and communicate with each other to accomplish business tasks.  They are usually controlled by a central service that acts as a “discovery” tool and a messaging broker. This design allows for rapid “recoding” of particular services.  These new instances can be deployed in parallel without impeding the previous iteration of the service, and traffic can slowly be moved to the new version of the service on the old version phased out.
